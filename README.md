# liri-node-app

This is an app is a very basic language interpretation and recognition interface, which can return twitter, movie, and music data.  

## Getting Started

This app is available from my GitHub account at https://github.com/ehlerorngard/liri-node-app.  

### Prerequisites

You'll need node package manager.  


### Installing

To run this app you'll need these three packages installed:  twitter, node-spotify-api, and request.  

At the directory's root after cloning down the repository, enter in the terminal:

```
npm install twitter
npm install node-spotify-api
npm install request

```

API keys are required to access the APIs;  if they keys utilized in the code aren't working, you'll need to request your own and insert them.
